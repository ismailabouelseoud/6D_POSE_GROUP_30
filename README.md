# 6D POSE GROUP 30 

GitHub repository containing the code for 6D pose estimation project, MLDL.  
The dataset needed to run the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19ivHpaKm9dOrr12fzC8IDFczWRPFxho7).  
If you want to skip the YOLOv11 finetuning you can find its output in the **YOLOv11_finetuning** directory. The model's weights are stored in the **YOLOv11_finetuning/weights/best.pt** file.  
You can find the densefusion inspired architecture (as per code) weights for several hyperparameters combinations along with the training plots [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C3ol0d3cCNJVmwH7Zuv1oy6GfrurOIDd?usp=sharing).  
In case you get redirected to a parent directory by clicking on the link, the above results are saved in the directory **01_MODEL_STATS**.
